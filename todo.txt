Things that I would like to do in the future:
* Make the program read a global config file for parameters like expected
capture range, LED count, blend and smooth parameters, etc.
* Make install step that installs the service file and adds the program to
the startup list.
* There's an annoying bug with the service file where issuing the stop
command will instead attempt to start it.  Not sure why.
* Stricter warning compile settings.
